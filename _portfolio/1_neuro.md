In this project, we analyzed sEMG measurements of professional athletes. I worked on this project for three years as a Consultant for Machine Learning in Signal Processing at [Neurocess](https://www.neurocess.co/)

* In [Attention-Enhanced Frequency-Split Convolution Block for sEMG Motion Classification: Experiments on Premier League and Ninapro Datasets](https://erkan1863.github.io/publication/2023-12-28-COZDAL), we have presented convolutional octave-band zooming-in with depth-kernel attention learning (COZDAL), a versatile deep learning model designed for surface electromyography (sEMG) motion classification. 

* In [A Novel Framework for Motion-Induced Artefact Cancellation in sEMG: Evaluation on English Premier League and Ninapro Datasets](https://erkan1863.github.io/publication/2024-03-28-Noise), we have study proposes a framework involving two consecutive models specifically designed to detect Motion-Induced Artifact (MIA) zones in the sEMG stream and to denoise MIA.  For the denoising of MIA, a novel convolution block within the U-net Encoder Decoder (UED) is introduced, featuring attention-enhanced kernel and channel selection.

* In [sEMG Motion Classification Via Few-Shot Learning With Applications To Sports Science](https://erkan1863.github.io/publication/2023-04-08-FSL), we have utilised few-shot learning (FSL) techniques to overcome the small dataset problem of sports-related motion classification tasks. The employed methodology uses the knowledge gathered from a large set of tasks to classify unseen tasks with a few data samples. 

* We presented our study on 'Cooperation of Isometric Force Test and EMG for Hamstring Injury Prevention' at the [Isokinetic Conference23](https://isokineticconference.com/2024-edition/) in London.
