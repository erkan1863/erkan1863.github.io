In this project, we have analyzed the gossip networks from various aspects.

In [Constructing Stochastic Matrices for Weighted Averaging in Gossip Networks](https://erkan1863.github.io/publication/2025-02-27-contructing_matrices), we propose an algorithm for constructing (local) stochastic matrices based on a given gossip network topology and a set of weights for averaging across different consensus clusters, ensuring that the gossip process converges to a finite limit set.

In [Age of Coded Updates In Gossip Network Under Memory and Memoryless Scheme](https://erkan1863.github.io/publication/2024-10-29-age_of_coded), we have analyzed k-out-of-n threshold systems on a gossip network, each receiver node requires at least k different keys out of total n keys with the same version, shared over peer-to-peer connections. We consider two type of node subscriber nodes, which receive a unique key from the source node for every status update instantaneously, and nonsubscriber nodes. 

In [Age of k-out-of-n Systems on a Gossip Network](https://erkan1863.github.io/publication/2024-02-18-age_k_n_TSS_on_gossip), we have analyzed k-out-of-n systems  on a gossip network, in which for decryption, each receiver node requires at least k different keys out of total n keys with the same version, shared over peer-to-peer connections. 

In [Vector-Valued Gossip over w-Holonomic Networks](https://erkan1863.github.io/publication/2023-11-08-holonomy_over_gossip), we have provided conditions for the convergence of this non-homogeneous Markov process as well as the characterization of its limit set.
