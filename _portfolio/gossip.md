In this project, I have analyze the gossip network from various aspects.

In [Vector-Valued Gossip over w-Holonomic Networks](https://erkan1863.github.io/publication/2023-11-08-holonomy_over_gossip), I have provided conditions for the convergence of this non-homogeneous Markov process as well as the characterization of its limit set. 

In [Age of (k,n)-Threshold Signature Scheme on a Gossip Network](https://erkan1863.github.io/publication/2024-02-18-age_k_n_TSS_on_gossip), I analyze (k,n)-TSS on a gossip network, in which for decryption, each receiver node requires at least different keys with the same version, shared over peer-to-peer connections.
