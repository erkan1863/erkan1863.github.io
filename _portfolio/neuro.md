In this project, we have analyzed sEMG measuremnt of professional athlete. I have completed this project as Signal Processing Focus Data Science Consultant at [Neurocess](https://www.neurocess.co/)

In [Attention-Enhanced Frequency-Split Convolution Block for sEMG Motion Classification: Experiments on Premier League and Ninapro Datasets](https://erkan1863.github.io/publication/2023-12-28-COZDAL), we have presented convolutional octave-band zooming-in with depth-kernel attention learning (COZDAL), a versatile deep learning model designed for surface electromyography (sEMG) motion classification. 

In [sEMG Motion Classification Via Few-Shot Learning With Applications To Sports Science](https://erkan1863.github.io/publication/2023-04-08-FSL), we have utilised few-shot learning (FSL) techniques to overcome the small dataset problem of sports-related motion classification tasks. The employed methodology uses the knowledge gathered from a large set of tasks to classify unseen tasks with a few data samples.
