I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) ECE under the co-advisory of [Prof. Tamer Basar](http://tamerbasar.csl.illinois.edu/) and [Prof. Mohamed-Ali Belabbas](https://publish.illinois.edu/belabbas/). I have obtained my B.Sc. degree from [Bilkent University](https://ee.bilkent.edu.tr/en/) Electrical and Electronics Engineering department. 

I have focused on the efficient utilization of neural networks under communication and control constraints for edge (distributed) devices applications e.g. sEMG sensor, audio-noise cancellation.
