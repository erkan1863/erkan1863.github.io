I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) ECE under the co-advisory of [Prof. Tamer Basar](http://tamerbasar.csl.illinois.edu/) and [Prof. Mohamed-Ali Belabbas](https://publish.illinois.edu/belabbas/). I graduated from [Bilkent University](https://ee.bilkent.edu.tr/en/) Electrical and Electronics Engineering department. I have mainly focused on data analysis and control theory. I am interested in sport science and developing projects to analyze performance by machine learning on sEMG and location tracking data.
