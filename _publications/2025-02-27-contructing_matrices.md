The convergence of the gossip process has been extensively studied; however, algorithms that generate a set of stochastic matrices, the infinite product of which converges to a rank-one matrix determined by a given weight vector, have been less explored. In this work, we propose an algorithm for constructing (local) stochastic matrices based on a given gossip network topology and a set of weights for averaging across different consensus clusters, ensuring that the gossip process converges to a finite limit set.
