We consider information update systems on a gossip network, which consists of a single source and  receiver nodes. The source encrypts the information into  distinct keys with version stamps, sending a unique key to each node. For decryption in a -Threshold Signature Scheme, each receiver node requires at least  different keys with the same version, shared over peer-to-peer connections. We consider two different schemes: a memory scheme (in which the nodes keep the source's current and previous encrypted messages) and a memoryless scheme (in which the nodes are allowed to only keep the source's current message). We measure the ''timeliness'' of information updates by using the version age of information. Our work focuses on determining closed-form expressions for the time average age of information in a heterogeneous random graph. Our work not only allows to verify the expected outcome that a memory scheme results in a lower average age compared to a memoryless scheme, but also provides the quantitative difference between the two. In our numerical results, we quantify the value of memory and demonstrate that the advantages of memory diminish with infrequent source updates, frequent gossipping between nodes, or a decrease in  for a fixed number of nodes.
